## 5. Core Features (Tabs)

The program includes several tabs for performing different programming-related tasks:

### 5.1. Code Summary (üß†)

*   **Purpose**: Quickly understand long or complex code snippets by obtaining a summary of their main functionality and important parts.
*   **Usage**:
    1.  Paste the code you want to summarize into the "Source Code" input field.
    2.  Alternatively, click the "üìé Attach File" button to select a code file (e.g., `.py`, `.txt`) from your computer.
    3.  Click the "Summarize Code" button.
*   **Result**: Gemini will analyze the code and provide a textual summary (in Markdown format) in the "Result from Gemini" area.

### 5.2. Generate Function (üõ†Ô∏è)

*   **Purpose**: Create Python function code based on a textual description of the desired task.
*   **Usage**:
    1.  In the "Describe the desired function" field, write a clear and detailed description of the function you want to create.
    2.  (Optional) In the "Optional libraries" field, list any Python libraries (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`), separated by commas, that you would like the model to use when generating the function.
    3.  Click the "Generate Function" button.
*   **Result**: Gemini will generate Python function code (enclosed in ```python ... ``` Markdown) based on your description.

### 5.3. Debug Code (üö®)

*   **Purpose**: Help identify potential errors, logical issues, or improvement suggestions in existing code.
*   **Usage**:
    1.  Paste the code you want to analyze into the "Source Code" input field.
    2.  Alternatively, click the "üìé Attach File" button to select a code file.
    3.  Click the "Analyze Code" button.
*   **Result**: Gemini will provide a report (in Markdown format) explaining potential problems in the code, with suggestions for correction or improvement.

### 5.4. Convert Library (üîÑ)

*   **Purpose**: Transform Python code written using one library to work with an alternative library (e.g., converting UI code from Tkinter to PyQt5).
*   **Usage**:
    1.  Paste the original code into the "Source Code" field or attach a file.
    2.  In the "Source Library" field, enter the name of the library used in the original code (e.g., `tkinter`).
    3.  In the "Target Library" field, enter the name of the library you want to convert to (e.g., `PyQt5`).
    4.  Click the "Convert Library" button.
*   **Result**: Gemini will attempt to provide a version of the code modified to use the target library, preserving functionality as much as possible.

### 5.5. Translate Code (üåê)

*   **Purpose**: Translate code snippets from one programming language to another.
*   **Usage**:
    1.  Paste the code you want to translate into the "Source Code" field or attach a file.
    2.  From the "Source Language" dropdown, select the original programming language of the code. (The program attempts to guess this when attaching a file based on its extension).
    3.  From the "Target Language" dropdown, select the programming language you want to translate the code into.
    4.  Click the "Translate Code" button.
*   **Result**: Gemini will provide the code translated into the target language, enclosed in a Markdown code block appropriate for the target language.

### Common Controls for Tab Results

Below the "Result from Gemini" area in each tab, you will find the following buttons:

#### Copy Result (üìã)

*   Copies the content of the result area (as plain text) to the system clipboard, allowing you to paste it into your code editor or elsewhere.

#### Save Result (üíæ)

*   Opens a dialog to save the content of the result area to a file.
*   You can choose the filename, location, and type (defaults to `.md` or `.py` if the content looks like Python code).

#### Regenerate (üîÅ)

*   Resends the *exact same last request* that produced the currently displayed result to Gemini.
*   This is useful for getting an alternative or differently phrased answer without re-entering data.
*   It uses a slightly higher temperature setting in the `GeminiWorker` to encourage varied output.
*   If there was no previous request in the current tab, a message will indicate this.

## 6. Advanced Features

### Context Enrichment via `docs` Folder

*   You can create a folder named `docs` in the same directory where the main program executable (`app.py`) is located.
*   Place text files (`.txt`) or Markdown files (`.md`) inside this folder containing additional information about your project, such as:
    *   Portions of project documentation.
    *   Specific requirements.
    *   Preferred coding style.
    *   Relevant code snippets.
*   When you send any request to Gemini, the program will read the content of these files and append it to the prompt as additional context. This helps Gemini understand your project better and provide more accurate and tailored responses.
*   Upon program startup, you will be notified if files were loaded from this folder or if the folder was not found/empty.

### Token Usage Tracking and Rate Limits

*   **Usage Display**: After each successful request, the program will attempt to display the number of tokens consumed (prompt, candidate, and total) in the status bar.
*   **Rate Limit Tracking (RPM/TPM)**:
    *   The program performs approximate tracking of Requests Per Minute (RPM) and Tokens Per Minute (TPM) consumed *during the current application session*.
    *   RPM and TPM limits for each model are defined in `core/config.py` (in the `MODEL_LIMITS` dictionary). **Important**: Ensure these values match the official Google limits for your specific models and API key.
    *   If usage approaches these limits (default 80%, defined by `RATE_LIMIT_WARNING_THRESHOLD` in `core/config.py`), a warning message will appear in the status bar.
    *   If the calculated RPM limit is reached, a new request might be temporarily blocked, and a dialog box will appear.
*   **Tracking Limitations**:
    *   Tracking is only for the current session and does not account for usage via other applications or previous sessions.
    *   Daily limits (RPD) are not directly tracked within the application.
    *   **For accurate information on your usage and remaining quota, always refer to your Google Cloud Console or Google AI Studio dashboard.**

## 7. Troubleshooting

### "Permission Denied 403" Error

*   **Cause**: This usually indicates an issue with the permissions related to your Gemini API key.
*   **Potential Solutions**:
    1.  **Verify API Key**: Ensure the key entered in settings is correct and not expired. Try generating a new key.
    2.  **Enable API for Project**: If using a Google Cloud key, make sure the "Generative Language API" (or Gemini equivalent) is enabled for your project.
    3.  **API Key Restrictions**: Check any restrictions applied to your API key in the Google Cloud Console (IP restrictions, allowed APIs).
    4.  **Billing Issues**: Ensure your Google Cloud project has an active and valid billing account.

### "API Key Missing" Error

*   **Cause**: The Gemini API key has not been entered in the program settings.
*   **Solution**: Go to "File" -> "Settings" and enter a valid API key in the designated field.

### No Results Displayed

*   **Potential Causes**:
    *   Internet connectivity issues.
    *   Incorrect API key or permission problems (see 403 error).
    *   API rate limits exceeded (RPM, TPM, or daily limits). Check the status bar for warnings and consult your Google Cloud Console.
    *   The prompt you sent might have been blocked by Gemini's safety filters.
    *   Temporary issues with Gemini servers.
*   **Solution**: Check your internet connection, API key validity, and usage limits. Try simplifying your prompt. If the issue persists, wait a while and try again.

### Markdown Display Issues

*   **Cause**: The program uses the `markdown2` library to convert Gemini's Markdown responses to HTML for display.
*   **Solution**:
    *   Ensure `markdown2` and `Pygments` (for code highlighting) are correctly installed (via `requirements.txt`).
    *   If the display is still not perfect, it might be due to the complexity of the returned Markdown or limitations in the simple HTML conversion used.
